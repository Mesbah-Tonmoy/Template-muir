                        <p class="smaller">The SpaceX rocket booster that carried two NASA astronauts on a historic journey to the International Space Station two months ago took flight once again on Monday evening — this time to launch a hefty communications satellite into orbit.<br>
                            The rocket took off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station around 5:30 pm ET.<br>
                            Inside the bulbous nose cone at the rocket's tip was a communications satellite that belongs to the South Korean military. SpaceX did not show the satellite deploying from rocket, something the company typically leaves out of its webcasts when taking sensitive national security-related cargo to space.
                            <br><br>
                            But the company did show the landing of its first-stage booster, the bottom-most portion of the rocket equipped with nine massive engines that provided the Falcon 9 rocket's initial thrust at liftoff. The rocket booster SpaceX used for Monday's mission was previously flown on SpaceX's first-ever mission with humans on board.</p>

                    <p class="smaller w-558">For years, the company has routinely recovered the boosters: After the first-stage spends most of its fuel, it detaches from the rocket's second stage and then steers itself back to an upright landing on seafaring platforms or a ground pad.<br>
                        <br>
                        The second, non-reusable stage of the rocket then fires up its own engine to finish off the mission.<br>
                        Recapturing, refurbishing and reflying rocket hardware saves SpaceX money, the company says, and it's at the core of CEO Elon Musk's mission to drive down the cost of launching satellites — or people — into outer space.<br>
                        <br>
                        The company's success in developing reusable rocket technology upended a fairly uncompetitive industry, and many of its competitors, such as legacy rocket builder United Launch Alliance and newcomer Blue Origin, are attempting to create reusable vehicles of their own.</p>
